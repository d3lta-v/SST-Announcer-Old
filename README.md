##Caveats:
* The Xcode Project file must be opened in Xcode 6 for iOS 8 SDK
* SwiftLint is required. If you do not need SwiftLint, you have to remove the final build phrase
* All the external dependencies MUST be met in order to compile the project (including account-specific dependencies such as Fabric). If you choose not to, you have to delete the run scripts phrase and delete the dependency entirely from the project.
